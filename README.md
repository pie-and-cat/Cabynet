CSC 3380 Class Project 

## Project Overview

  The coronavirus pandemic put a massive strain on medical resources, putting a particularly large burden on the elderly. Containing mild cases has been paramount, but these treatments often come with extensive care plans and multiple prescriptions. Balancing these factors can be hardest for those who need them the most. For this, we propose a bridge of sorts, using an app to manage prescriptions and keep patients on track with their treatment. With this, we can lessen the chance of incorrect dosing, and potentially eliminate unneeded strain on our medical system. 

To do this, our app uses Free OCR API to scan text from the user's bottle, parses that text and outputs it into a calendar. Our codebase is written and flutter and dart, for effective rapid development. 

Our project built our calendar based on Parth Baraiya's calendar project:

Our camera input is based on the flutter documentation for camera input:

Our OCR API is from:
