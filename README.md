CSC 3380 Class Project 

## Project Overview

  The coronavirus pandemic put a massive strain on medical resources, putting a particularly large burden on the elderly. Containing mild cases has been paramount, but these treatments often come with extensive care plans and multiple prescriptions. Balancing these factors can be hardest for those who need them the most. For this, we propose a bridge of sorts, using an app to manage prescriptions and keep patients on track with their treatment. With this, we can lessen the chance of incorrect dosing, and potentially eliminate unneeded strain on our medical system. 

To do this, our app will access the Free OCR API to scan text from userâ€™s prescription bottles. Our codebase will be written in Flutter and Dart, for effective rapid development.
